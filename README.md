# L3S1_Projet_Art_Abstrait_Arbre

The goal of this project is to generate images like paintings in abstract art form. Indeed, 20th century painter Piet Mondrian was an artist characterized by his very geometric works. We had to create two methods of generating paintings randomly.  The application is coded in Java. For the first part of the project, the application is organized around four classes including two main classes: the Kd _tree class and the AVL class.  For the second part we have: the class pq _node, the class Point, the class fourZones.
